# Todo List Kanban
This is a simple to-do list application built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The application features a Kanban-style layout with four sections: "To-Do," "In Progress," "Testing," and "Completed."

Users can add tasks to the "To-Do" section by clicking the "Add Task" button, a new task will be created with the content "New Todo Task" and it will be added to the "To-Do" section. The user can change the content of a task by clicking on it and editing the text. Tasks can be moved between sections by dragging and dropping them to the desired location. Users can also change the background color of a task by hovering over it and then clicking on the desired color from the color palette that appears. The user can also delete it.

All tasks and their respective sections are stored in the browser's local storage, so the order of tasks and their location will remain the same even after the page is refreshed.

## Instructions
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
3. Click the "Add Task" button to add a new task to the "To-Do" section with the content "New Todo Task"
4. Drag and drop tasks between sections to change their status.
5. Click on the task to edit its content.
6. Hover over the task to display the color palette, and then click on the desired color to change the task's background color.
7. Click on the trash icon to delete the task.
### Note
